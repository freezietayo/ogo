    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>
               <strong> Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
